  <section>
    <p>Hello! I'm an aspiring game developer from Kerala.</p>
    <p>I enjoy creating games and learning new technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.</p>
    <p>I started my journey with small projects and plan to share my progress, ideas, and games on this website.</p>
    <p>In addition to game development, I also like working on websites and exploring new programming languages.</p>
    <p>Feel free to check out my work and reach out if you’re interested in collaboration!</p>
